# VietnamAlgorithmicTrading
About my self:
I am a finance major in RMIT Vietnam, but I have a huge passion for Computer science
-> Therefore, algorithmic trading is the best combination



Within this project, the data source is by Pham Dinh Khanh and his package vnquant, which is really usefull and accurate.

The backtesting is by the book Python for Algorithimc trading, with a little modified to fit with the Vietnam Stock market.
There are still lots of bugs in this program, however, I'm continually learning and updating it.

I hope anyone who see this and find some bugs, just contact me and help me out!
Thank you,
Quoc Hung
